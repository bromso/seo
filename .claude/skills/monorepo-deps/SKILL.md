description: MUST USE for ANY request involving npm/bun packages, dependencies, versions, lockfiles, or security audits in this Bun + Turborepo monorepo. Use when adding, removing, updating, bumping, upgrading, or downgrading any package or library (React, date-fns, lodash, etc.) in any workspace (apps/app, apps/www, packages/ui, etc.), checking what's outdated, running security audits, fixing peer dependency warnings, resolving lockfile (bun.lock) merge conflicts, or deciding whether a dep change needs a changeset. Trigger phrases — "update React", "bump packages", "upgrade to latest", "add date-fns", "add a dependency to apps/app", "what's outdated", "outdated packages in the monorepo", "lockfile conflict", "merge conflict in bun.lock", "security audit", "bun audit", "do I need a changeset for this dep bump", "peer dependency warning", "bun install".

# Monorepo Dependency Management

Manage dependencies in this Bun-based Turborepo monorepo.

## Project Context

- **Package manager:** Bun 1.3.x (declared in root `package.json` as `"packageManager": "bun@1.3.4"`)
- **Workspaces:** `apps/*`, `packages/*`
- **Lockfile:** `bun.lock` at repo root (single lockfile for the whole monorepo)
- **Build orchestration:** Turborepo
- **Releases:** changesets (`bun changeset` to create one)
- **Pinned via root `overrides`:** `react`, `react-dom`, `react-hook-form`, `@hookform/resolvers`

## Adding a Dependency

To a specific workspace:

```bash
bun add <pkg> --cwd apps/app          # runtime dep
bun add -d <pkg> --cwd apps/app       # dev dep
bun add <pkg> --cwd packages/ui
```

To the root (rare — only for tooling that runs at repo level):

```bash
bun add -D <pkg>
```

After adding, run from root:

```bash
bun install   # ensures lockfile and node_modules are coherent
```

## Updating Dependencies

Check what's outdated:

```bash
bun outdated                          # whole monorepo
bun outdated --filter @repo/app       # one workspace
```

Update:

```bash
bun update <pkg>                      # all workspaces using it
bun update --cwd apps/app <pkg>       # just one workspace
bun update --latest                   # major bumps too (caution)
```

After any update:
1. `bun install`
2. `bun typecheck` (delegates to `turbo check-types`)
3. `bun lint`
4. `bun run build`
5. If runtime libs changed: `bun --filter @repo/app dev` and smoke-test
6. If breaking changes were necessary: add a changeset (`bun changeset`)

## React / RHF Pinning

Root `package.json` has:

```json
"overrides": {
  "react": "^19.1.1",
  "react-dom": "^19.1.1",
  "react-hook-form": "^7.66.1",
  "@hookform/resolvers": "^5.2.2"
}
```

Don't bump these in individual workspace `package.json` files — bump the override at root. Bun will hoist the version everywhere.

## Security Audits

```bash
bun audit
```

For high/critical advisories, prefer upgrading to the patched version. If no patch exists, document the rationale in the changeset.

## Lockfile Conflicts

When `bun.lock` conflicts on a merge:

1. Don't edit it by hand
2. Take the incoming version: `git checkout --theirs bun.lock` (or `--ours`)
3. `bun install`
4. Commit the regenerated lockfile

## Common Pitfalls

- Don't run `npm install` or `pnpm install` — only `bun install`
- Don't edit `bun.lock` manually
- Don't add a changeset for internal-only changes (e.g., bumping a dev tool nobody depends on)
- After major bumps, ALWAYS run the full `bun validate` before declaring done
